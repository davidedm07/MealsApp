# Meals_App

This app is the second project made in the course [
Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2021 Edition]](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/#instructor-2).

This project has the aim of teaching how to create an app with multiple screens and navigate from one to another.

## Main page

In the main page it is possible to select a food category, switch between the meals and favourites tabs, open the filters to show only some foods based on some properties (e.g. lactose-free, vegetarian and so on)
